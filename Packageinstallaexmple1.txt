If you're going to do this, why require the user to tell the script which tool to use?

#!/bin/bash

   exit 1

Command lsb_release can you help.

usually I do dpkg -i <deb file>, it'll fail saying it needs dependencies. After that when you do an apt-get update it'll say at the end something like "dependencies are ready to install" I think it then advises to use apt-get install -f.

Once that's done, I use dpkg -i again.

Worked fine for me last few years.

edit: looking a bit further, apparently a tool called gdebi can do this as gdebi [deb file].

Sirex has it more or less correct, but his answer isn't clear. I just solved this, so here's what I did:

sudo dpkg -i /path/to/filename.deb

If this fails with a message about the package depending on something that isn't installed, you can probably fix it if you run

sudo apt-get -f install

This will install the dependencies (assuming they're available in the repos your system knows about) AND the package you were originally requesting to install ('f' is the 'fix' option and 'y' is the 'assume yes to prompts' or 'don't ask me if it's ok, just install it already' option -- very useful for scripted silent installs). On the system I was on, there was no need to run dpkg again (Ubuntu lucid 10.04).

I found it interesting that if you leave off the -f when you run sudo apt-get install, it will list your package as not being configured due to an unresolved dependency as well as helpfully suggesting: Unmet dependencies. Try 'apt-get -f install' with no packages (or specify a solution).

Edit:

If you want install without having to answer 'y' to all of the questions, you can add the y modifier as I originally included: sudo apt-get -fy install. However, a commenter pointed out that apt will sometimes suggest that you uninstall your entire desktop environment. I was doing this work in a VM and didn't have that concern, but this post has been updated to reflect being a bit more careful.

You can also install .deb file using gdebi.Run the below commands to install gdebi,

sudo apt-get install gdebi-core

Install .deb packages with gdebi,

sudo gdebi /path/to/filename.deb

Ubuntu Linux: How Do I install .deb Packages?
by Vivek Gite on June 22, 2006 last updated August 11, 2013
in Debian / Ubuntu, Package Management, Ubuntu Linux

I am a new Ubuntu Linux user. I need to install a package called package.deb. I know I can use Synaptic front-end package management tool to install packages from the CD or Internet. But, I would like to install a special .deb file. How can I install .deb package from the terminal using command line option in Ubuntu Linux or Debian Linux?

You need to use the dpkg command, which is a package manager from shell/command prompt for Debian and Ubuntu Linux. You can use this tool to install, build, remove and manage packages. dpkg itself is controlled entirely via command line parameters.

Syntax

The syntax is as follows:

dpkg -i package-name-here.deb
dpkg --install package-name-here.deb
dpkg -i -R /path/to/dir/name/with/lots/of/dot-deb-files/
dpkg -i --recursive /path/to/dir/name/with/lots/of/dot-deb-files/

Where,

    -i or --install : Install the package.
    -R or --recursive : Recursively installed all *.deb files found at specified directories and all of its sub-directories. /path/to/dir/name/with/lots/of/dot-deb-files/ must refer to a directory instead of package-name-here.deb file name.

How do I install .deb file?

To install a single package file called /tmp/package.deb type the following commands. Open a terminal and then cd to directory where package.deb is kept. In this example, package.deb is kept in /tmp directory:
$ cd /tmp

Type the following command to install the package:
$ sudo dpkg -i package.deb

OR
# dpkg -i package.deb
Install all packages from /nfs/pkgs/ubuntu-builds directory

Recursively handle and install all regular files matching pattern *.deb found at /nfs/pkgs/ubuntu-builds/ directory and all of its subdirectories, type:
$ sudo dpkg -i -R /nfs/pkgs/ubuntu-builds/

OR
# dpkg -i -R /nfs/pkgs/ubuntu-builds/

Debian Linux apt-get package management cheat sheet
by Vivek Gite on May 9, 2005 last updated May 19, 2015
in Debian Linux, Howto, Linux, Sys admin, Tips, Ubuntu Linux

Both Debian and Ubuntu Linux provides a number of package management tools. This article summaries package management command along with it usage and examples for you.

    apt-get : APT is acronym for Advanced Package Tool. It supports installing packages over internet using ftp or http protocols. You can also upgrade all packages in a single operations, which makes it even more attractive.
    dpkg : Debian packaging tool which can be use to install, query, uninstall packages.

    Gui tools: You can also try GUI based or high level interface to the Debian GNU/Linux package system. Following list summaries them:
        aptitude: It is a text-based interface to the Debian GNU/Linux package system.
        synaptic: GUI front end for APT

Red hat Linux package names generally end in .rpm, similarly Debian package names end in .deb, for example:

apache_1.3.31-6_i386.deb

Where,

    apache : Package name
    1.3.31-6 : Version number
    i386 : Hardware Platform on which this package will run (i386 == intel x86 based system)
    .deb : Extension that suggest it is a Debian package

Remember, whenever I refer .deb file it signifies complete file name, and whenever I refer package name it must be first part of .deb file. For example, when I refer to a package sudo it means sudo only and not the .deb file i.e. sudo_1.6.7p5-2_i386.deb. You can find out debian package name with the following command:

apt-cache search {package-name}
apt-cache search apache

Finally, most of the actions listed in this post are written with the assumption that they will be executed by the root user running the bash or any other modern shell.
apt-get add a new package

Add a new package called samba. The syntax is:

apt-get install {package-name}

To install a package called samba, run:

# apt-get install samba

apt-get remove the package called samba but keep the configuration files

The syntax is:

apt-get remove {package-name}

Example:

# apt-get remove samba

apt-get remove (erase) package and configuration file

The syntax is:

apt-get --purge remove {package-name}

Example:

# apt-get --purge remove samba

apt-get update (upgrade) package

The syntax is:

apt-get upgrade

To upgrade individual package called sudo, enter:
# apt-get install sudo
apt-get display available software updates

Following command will display the list of all available upgrades (updates) using -u option, if you decided to upgrade all of the shown packages just hit ‘y’

# apt-get upgrade samba

However if you just wish to upgrade individual package then use apt-get command and it will take care of rest of your worries:

apt-get install {package-name}

dpkg command to get package information such as description of package, version etc.

The syntax is:

dpkg --info {.deb-package-name}

Example:

# dpkg --info sudo_1.6.7p5-2_i386.deb | less

List all installed packages

The syntax is:

dpkg -l

Example:

# dpkg -l

To list individual package try such as apache

# dpkg -l apache

You can also use this command to see (verify) if package sudo is install or not (note that if package is installed then it displays package name along with small description):

# dpkg -l | grep -i 'sudo'

To list packages related to the apache:

# dpkg -l '*apache*'

List files provided (or owned) by the installed package (for example what files are provided by the installed samba package). The syntax is:

dpkg -L {package-name}

Example:

# dpkg -L samba

(H) List files provided (or owned) by the package (for example what files are provided by the uninstalled sudo package). The syntax is:

dpkg --contents {.deb-package-name}

Example:

# dpkg --contents sudo_1.6.7p5-2_i386.deb

Find, what package owns the file /bin/netstat?

The syntax is:

dpkg -S {/path/to/file}

Example:

# dpkg -S /bin/netstat

Search for package or package description

Some times you don’t know package name but aware of some keywords to search the package. Once you got package name you can install it using apt-get -i {package-name} command:

apt-cache search "Text-to-search"
apt-cache search "httpd"
apt-cache search "web server"
apt-cache search "web server"| grep something

Find out all the Debian package which can be used for Intrusion Detection

Type the following command:

# apt-cache search "Intrusion Detection"

Find out all sniffer packages, run:

# apt-cache search sniffer

Find out if Debian package is installed or not (status)

The syntax is:

dpkg -s {package-name} |  grep Status

Example:

# dpkg -s samba| grep Status

List each dependency a package has…

Display a listing of each dependency a package has and all the possible other packages that can fulfill that dependency. You hardly use this command as apt-get does decent job fulfill all package dependencies. The syntax is:

apt-cache depends package

Display dependencies for lsof and mysql-server packages:

# apt-cache depends lsof
# apt-cache depends mysql-server
